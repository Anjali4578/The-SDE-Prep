A Segment Tree is a data structure that stores information about array intervals as a tree. This allows answering range queries over an array efficiently, while still being flexible enough to allow quick modification of the array. This includes finding the sum of consecutive array elements , or finding the minimum element in a such a range in  time. Between answering such queries, the Segment Tree allows modifying the array by replacing one element, or even changing the elements of a whole subsegment (e.g. assigning all elements  to any value, or adding a value to all element in the subsegment).
